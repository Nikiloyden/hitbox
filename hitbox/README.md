# Hitbox

Highly customizable async caching framework for Rust designed for high-performance applications.

Hitbox is **protocol-agnostic** at its core, with first-class HTTP support via [`hitbox-http`].
It provides pluggable backends from in-memory ([Moka]) to distributed solutions ([Redis]).
Built on [Tower], it works with any tokio-based service.

## Quick Start

If you need to add caching to your project, choose the appropriate integration based on your use case:

| Use Case | Crate | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Server-side** (Axum, Tower-based frameworks) | [`hitbox-tower`] | Tower middleware layer for HTTP handlers |
| **Client-side** (Hyper) | [`hitbox-tower`] | Tower middleware layer for hyper client |
| **Client-side** (Reqwest) | [`hitbox-reqwest`] | Cache responses from external APIs via reqwest-middleware |

For detailed usage, see the documentation for these crates and the
[examples](https://github.com/hit-box/hitbox/tree/main/examples) directory.

## Understanding Hitbox

### The Hitbox Ecosystem

Hitbox is organized as a collection of crates, each with a specific responsibility:

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`hitbox`] | Main crate — re-exports core types, policy configuration, error types |
| [`hitbox-core`] | Protocol-agnostic core traits ([`Predicate`], [`Extractor`], [`CacheableRequest`], [`CacheableResponse`]) |
| [`hitbox-backend`] | [`Backend`] trait and utilities for implementing storage backends |
| [`hitbox-http`] | HTTP-specific predicates and extractors for request/response caching |
| [`hitbox-tower`] | Tower middleware (`Cache` layer) for server-side caching |
| [`hitbox-moka`] | In-memory backend using [Moka] |
| [`hitbox-redis`] | Distributed backend using [Redis] (single node and cluster) |
| [`hitbox-feoxdb`] | Embedded persistent backend using FeOxDB |
| [`hitbox-reqwest`] | Client-side caching for Reqwest via reqwest-middleware |
| [`hitbox-test`] | Testing utilities including `MockTime` for deterministic cache tests |

### Core Principles

Under the hood, Hitbox uses a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to orchestrate cache operations.
The FSM operates with four abstract traits that make Hitbox extensible to any protocol:

#### Backend

A **Backend** is a storage where cached data lives. It can be:

- **In-memory** — like [Moka] for single-instance, high-speed caching
- **Distributed** — like [Redis] (single node or cluster) for shared caching across instances
- **Embedded** — like [FeOxDB] for persistent local storage

If you need a backend for a database that isn't in our list, you can add it by implementing
the [`Backend`] trait. See the [`hitbox-backend`] documentation for details.

#### Upstream

An [`Upstream`] is a source of data. It could be:

- An HTTP handler in a web framework
- An external API call via Reqwest or Hyper
- Any async function that produces data

The FSM calls the Upstream when the cache misses (data not found in the Backend).

#### Predicate

A **Predicate** answers the question: *"Should this request/response be cached?"*

The easiest way to explain predicates is through HTTP examples:

**Request predicates** — We might want to cache requests that:
- Have a specific HTTP method (e.g., only GET requests)
- Match a particular path pattern
- Do NOT contain a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header
- Do NOT have a `cache=false` query parameter

**Response predicates** — We might want to cache responses that:
- Have a successful status code (2xx)
- Do NOT contain sensitive headers
- Have a body smaller than a certain size

Predicates implement the [`Predicate`] trait, which takes a request or response and returns
`Cacheable` or `NonCacheable`. They can be combined using AND (chaining), OR, and NOT logic.

#### Extractor

An [`Extractor`] creates the cache key from request components.

For HTTP, you might extract:
- **Method and path** as the base key
- **Path parameters** like `{user_id}` from `/api/users/{user_id}`
- **Query parameters** like `page` or `limit` that affect the response
- **Headers** like `Accept-Language` for localized content

Multiple extractors can be chained together, each contributing parts to the final cache key.

**Example:** For a request to `GET /api/users/123/posts?page=2` with `Accept-Language: en`,
an extractor configured for method, path params, query, and headers would produce a key
containing: `["GET", "123", "2", "en"]`.
