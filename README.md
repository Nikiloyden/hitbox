Highly customizable async caching framework for Rust designed for high-performance applications.

Protocol-agnostic async core + first-class HTTP support via hitbox-http. Pluggable backends from in-memory to distributed solutions such as Redis. Built on tower, works with any tokio-based service.

There are two common approaches to caching frameworks. The first is a low-level approach where you work directly with a cache instance, calling `get`, `set`, and `delete` methods and deciding exactly when and where to use them in your code. The second is a higher-level approach where the framework wraps your handlers or clients and automatically decides when to cache or invalidate data. Hitbox follows the second approach - its flexible configuration keeps caching logic out of your business code. 

While Hitbox is designed for large, high-load projects, it works equally well for small and simple ones. The configuration complexity scales with your project: simple projects need only simple settings.

## Motivation

Every real-world system brings a combination of shared challenges and unique constraints. We tried using existing caching frameworks for our services, but each time they failed to fully match our requirements. As a result, we repeatedly ended up building custom caching mechanisms from scratch instead of relying on ready-made solutions.

Hitbox was created to break this cycle.

We think of Hitbox not as a library, but as a platform for caching, designed from day one to be easily extensible without enforcing a single backend, protocol, or caching strategy. New storage backends, new protocols such as GraphQL or even the PostgreSQL protocol, as well as new serialization or compression strategies, are expected use cases - not special exceptions. You simply implement the required traits and go for it. Hitbox is built to be hacked, extended, bent, and reshaped.

A key principle of Hitbox is that every new integration automatically inherits the full set of advanced optimizations we built through real-world experience: dogpile-effect prevention, composable multi-layer caching (L1/L2/L3), offload caching, and more. Instead of re-implementing these mechanisms for every project, they come for free with the platform.

At the same time, Hitbox is not just an abstract foundation. It already provides a production-ready HTTP caching implementation based on [tower::Service](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/trait.Service.html), covering the most common use case out of the box while also serving as a reference implementation for building additional integrations.

## Stale Cache

Stale cache enables serving outdated data while refreshing in the background. Each cache entry has a TTL (fresh period) and an optional stale window (grace period). During TTL, data is fresh. After TTL but within the stale window, data is stale but servable. Three policies control stale behavior: `Return` serves stale data immediately without revalidation, `Revalidate` blocks until fresh data is fetched, and `OffloadRevalidate` serves stale data immediately while refreshing in the background (Stale-While-Revalidate pattern). The OffloadManager handles background revalidation with task deduplication, configurable timeouts (none, cancel, or warn), and metrics tracking.

### OffloadManager Configuration

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `max_concurrent_tasks` | Limit parallel background tasks | Unlimited |
| `timeout_policy` | `None`, `Cancel(duration)`, or `Warn(duration)` | `None` |
| `deduplicate` | Prevent duplicate revalidation for same key | `true` |

**Code example**

```rust
// Configure how background tasks are executed
let offload_config = OffloadConfig::builder()
    .max_concurrent_tasks(10)
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .deduplicate(true)
    .build();

let manager = OffloadManager::new(offload_config);

// Configure stale policy via PolicyConfig
let policy = PolicyConfig::builder()
    .ttl(Duration::from_secs(60))
    .stale(Duration::from_secs(300))
    .stale_policy(StalePolicy::OffloadRevalidate)
    .build();

// Add manager to Cache via .offload()
let cache = Cache::builder()
    .backend(backend)
    .config(policy)
    .offload(manager)
    .build();
```

## Dogpile Prevention

When a cache entry expires or is missing, multiple simultaneous requests can trigger redundant upstream calls - this is the "dogpile" or "thundering herd" problem.

Hitbox uses a configurable concurrency limit per cache key:
- First N requests (where N = concurrency limit) proceed to upstream
- Additional requests subscribe to a broadcast channel and wait
- When any request completes, it broadcasts the result to all waiters
- Waiters receive the response without calling upstream

With `concurrency: 1`, only one request fetches from upstream while others wait. But if that single request is slow, all waiting requests become slow too. Setting `concurrency: 2` or higher allows parallel fetches - the first to complete broadcasts to all waiters, reducing the impact of slow upstream responses.

**Code example**

```rust
// Create concurrency manager for dogpile prevention
let concurrency_manager = BroadcastConcurrencyManager::<Response>::new();

// Configure policy with concurrency limit
let policy = PolicyConfig::builder()
    .ttl(Duration::from_secs(60))
    .stale(Duration::from_secs(300))
    .concurrency(1)  // Only one request fetches, others wait
    .build();

// Add concurrency manager to Cache
let cache = Cache::builder()
    .backend(backend)
    .config(policy)
    .concurrency_manager(concurrency_manager)
    .build();
```

## Pluggable Backends

Backends store cached data. Each backend implements the `Backend` trait with `read`, `write`, and `remove` operations. All backends support configurable serialization format (Bincode, JSON, RON, Rkyv), key format (Bitcode, UrlEncoded), compression (Gzip, Zstd), and custom naming for metrics. Implement the `Backend` trait to add your own storage.

| Backend | Type | Configuration |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Moka | In-memory | `max_capacity` |
| Redis | Distributed | `connection` (single or cluster mode) |
| FeOxDB | Embedded | `path` or `in_memory()` |

**Code example**

```rust
// Moka (in-memory)
let moka = MokaBackend::builder()
    .max_entries(10_000)
    .value_format(BincodeFormat)
    .compressor(ZstdCompressor::default())
    .build();

// Redis (distributed)
let redis = RedisBackend::builder()
    .connection(ConnectionMode::single("redis://127.0.0.1/"))
    .value_format(BincodeFormat)
    .build()?;

// FeOxDB (embedded persistent)
let feoxdb = FeOxDbBackend::builder()
    .path("/tmp/cache".into())
    .build()?;

// ...

// Use backend with Cache
let cache = Cache::builder()
    .backend(moka)
    .config(policy)
    .build();
```

## Composable Backends

Compose multiple backends into tiered cache hierarchies, similar to CPU cache levels. Each composition has configurable read, write, and refill policies. Read policies control how layers are queried: Sequential (L1 first, then L2), Race (first hit wins), or Parallel (both queried, prefer fresher). Write policies control how data propagates: Sequential (L1 then L2), OptimisticParallel (both in parallel, succeed if any succeeds), or Race (first success wins). Refill policies control L1 population on L2 hits: Always or Never. Compositions can be nested for L1/L2/L3 hierarchies.

| Policy Type | Options | Default |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Read | Sequential, Race, Parallel | Sequential |
| Write | Sequential, OptimisticParallel, Race | OptimisticParallel |
| Refill | Always, Never | Never |

**Code example**

```rust
// L1 (Moka) + L2 (Redis) composition
let offload = OffloadManager::with_defaults();
let backend = moka.compose(redis, offload);

// With custom policies
let composition_policy = CompositionPolicy::new()
    .read(RaceReadPolicy::new())
    .write(SequentialWritePolicy::new())
    .refill(RefillPolicy::Always);

let backend = moka.compose_with(redis, offload, composition_policy);

// ...

// Use composed backend with Cache
let cache = Cache::builder()
    .backend(backend)
    .config(policy)
    .build();
```

## Serialization

Hitbox supports multiple serialization formats via the `Format` trait. Bincode offers the best write throughput and excellent read performance. Rkyv provides zero-copy deserialization for maximum read speed but slower writes. RON balances performance with human-readable output. JSON is slowest but useful for debugging. Choose based on your read/write ratio and debugging needs.

## Compression

Reduce cache storage size with optional compression via the `Compressor` trait. Zstd provides excellent compression ratio with fast decompression (levels -7 to 22, default 3). Gzip offers wide compatibility (levels 0-9, default 6). Both require feature flags (`zstd`, `gzip`). Skip compression for small payloads where overhead exceeds savings.

## Observability

Track cache performance with built-in metrics (via `metrics` crate):

- **Cache status** — hit, miss, and stale counters per backend
- **Latency histograms** — request duration and upstream call timing
- **Backend I/O** — reads, writes, bytes transferred, and errors per backend
- **Offload tasks** — spawned, completed, deduplicated, active, and timed out

Integrates with any `metrics`-compatible exporter (Prometheus, StatsD, etc.).

## Predicate and Extractor Traits

Hitbox provides two protocol-agnostic traits for extending caching to any protocol (GraphQL, gRPC, PostgreSQL wire protocol, etc.):

- **Predicate** controls what gets cached. Implement `check` to return `Cacheable` or `NonCacheable` for your request/response type.
- **Extractor** generates cache keys. Implement `get` to extract key components from requests. Multiple extractors can be chained, each contributing parts to the final key.

Hitbox provides a complete HTTP implementation in `hitbox-http`—use it as a reference when implementing your own protocol support.

## HTTP Predicates

HTTP Predicates control what gets cached. Request predicates filter incoming requests by method, path, headers, query parameters, and body. Response predicates filter upstream responses by status code, headers, and body. Both support operations like equality, existence, list matching, containment, and regex. Body predicates additionally support size limits and JQ expressions for JSON filtering. Combine predicates with AND (chaining), OR, and NOT logic.

**Tip:** Use `Operation::Limit { bytes: N }` on response body to prevent caching large responses (e.g., file downloads). This avoids cache bloat without reading the entire body.

**Code example**

```rust
use http::{Method, StatusCode, header::CACHE_CONTROL};
use hitbox_http::predicates::{
    request::Method as RequestMethod,
    response::StatusCode as ResponseStatusCode,
    header::{Header as RequestHeader, Operation as HeaderOperation},
};

// Request predicate: cache GET requests to /api/authors/{id}, skip if Cache-Control: no-cache
RequestMethod::new(Method::GET)
    .unwrap()
    .path("/api/authors/{id}".to_string())
    .and(
        RequestHeader::new(HeaderOperation::Contains(
            CACHE_CONTROL,
            "no-cache".to_string(),
        )).not()
    )

// Response predicate: only cache successful responses
ResponseStatusCode::new(StatusCode::OK)
```

## HTTP Extractors

HTTP Extractors build cache keys from request components. They extract values from method, path parameters (using `{param}` patterns), headers, query parameters, and body content. Headers and query parameters support exact name matching or prefix-based selection, with optional regex extraction for partial values. Body extraction supports full-body hashing, JQ expressions for JSON (with a custom `hash` function), and regex with named capture groups. Extracted values can be transformed using hash (SHA256), lowercase, or uppercase. Extractors chain together, combining all extracted parts into a single cache key.

**Code example**

```rust
use hitbox_http::extractors::{
    Method as MethodExtractor,
    Path as PathExtractor,
    query::QueryExtractor,
    header::HeaderExtractor,
};

// Extract method, path params, query params, and headers for cache key
MethodExtractor::new()
    .path("/v1/authors/{author_id}/books/{book_id}")
    .query("page".to_string())
    .header("Accept-Language".to_string())
```

A request to `/v1/authors/123/books/456?page=1` with `Accept-Language: en` produces a cache key with `method`, `author_id`, `book_id`, `page`, and `Accept-Language` components.

## Framework Integration

Hitbox integrates with both server-side frameworks and HTTP clients.

**Servers**

| Framework | Support |
|-----------|---------|
| Axum | Full support via tower layer |

Since Hitbox is built on tower, it integrates as a standard layer without framework-specific code. Any tower-compatible framework can use Hitbox.

**Clients**

| Client | Support |
|--------|---------|
| Hyper | Full support via tower layer |
| Reqwest | Full support via reqwest-middleware |

Since Hitbox is built on Tower, the same `hitbox-tower` Cache layer works for both server-side handlers and client-side hyper requests. For Reqwest, use `hitbox-reqwest` with `reqwest-middleware`.

## YAML Configuration (TBA)

Define your entire caching setup in a configuration file:

```yaml
backend:
  type: Moka
  max_capacity: 10000
  key:
    format: Bitcode
  value:
    format: Bincode
    compression:
      type: Zstd
      level: 3

request:
  - Method: GET
  - Path: "/api/authors/{author_id}"

response:
  - Status: Success

extractors:
  - Method:
  - Path: "/api/authors/{author_id}"
  - Query: page

policy:
  Enabled:
    ttl: 60
    stale: 300
    policy:
      stale: OffloadRevalidate
    concurrency: 1
```

Change caching rules at runtime - no recompilation needed.

## Benchmarks

These benchmarks help you understand the performance characteristics of Hitbox and make informed decisions about configuration. All micro-benchmarks use [Criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) with 100 samples.

### Is Hitbox Worth It?

**Worst case (100% cache misses):** Hitbox adds only **~20 µs** (microseconds, not milliseconds) overhead per request. This is negligible for most services.

**With cache hits:** Even if your handler is trivial (just returning static JSON with no I/O or CPU-heavy operations), cache hits are faster because they skip response serialization. Reading pre-serialized bytes from cache (~2 µs) is faster than serializing a struct to JSON every time.

**With slow upstreams:** The improvement scales with your upstream latency.

**Load test (50ms simulated backend latency):**

| Metric | Without Cache | With Hitbox | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Throughput | 970 req/s | 167,270 req/s | **172x** |
| Avg Latency | 51.6 ms | 0.295 ms | **175x** |
| p99 Latency | 52.7 ms | 0.917 ms | **57x** |

The slower your upstream, the bigger the win from caching.

### What Latency Does Hitbox Add?

**On cache HIT:** Hitbox *replaces* your upstream latency with just ~10-12 µs — this is a win.

**On cache MISS:** Hitbox *adds* ~20 µs overhead on top of your upstream latency.

The exact overhead depends on your predicates, extractors, and backend choice. Here's a typical breakdown:

| Component | Latency Added |
|-----------|---------------|
| Predicate evaluation (method + path + 2 headers) | ~1.3 µs |
| Cache key extraction | ~5.5 µs |
| Backend read (Moka, 5KB response) | ~2 µs |
| **Total overhead** | **~10-12 µs** |

For comparison: localhost Redis adds ~150 µs, same-datacenter Redis adds ~20 ms, and a database query adds 1-500 ms.

**Predicate latency by type:**

| Predicate Type | Latency |
|----------------|---------|
| Method match | 520 ns |
| Path match | 570 ns |
| Header check | 540 ns |
| Query parameter | 1.9 µs |
| 7-predicate chain | 3.3 µs |
| JQ body predicate | 25-65 µs |

**Optimization tip:** Predicates short-circuit on failure (628 ns). Place likely-to-fail predicates first to exit early.

**When Hitbox overhead matters:**
- If your upstream is < 100 µs (rare), caching may not help
- If using JQ body predicates, add ~25-65 µs to the overhead
- If your response is > 100KB, serialization becomes the bottleneck (see format selection below)

### Which Backend Should I Choose?

| Choose | When | Latency (5KB) | Trade-off |
|--------|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Moka** | Single instance, maximum speed | ~2 µs | No persistence, no sharing |
| **Moka + Redis** | Multiple instances, need consistency | ~2 µs hit, ~150 µs refill | Best of both worlds |
| **Redis** | Distributed cache, shared state | ~160 µs | Network latency |
| **FeOxDB** | Persistence without Redis | ~50 µs | Local only |

**Backend latency comparison:**

| Backend | 1KB Read | 100KB Read | Best For |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| Moka | 1.4 µs | 58 µs | Hot path, single instance |
| FeOxDB | 51 µs | 196 µs | Persistent local cache |
| Redis | 174 µs | 328 µs | Distributed, shared cache |

*Note: Redis benchmarks were run with localhost. Your network latency will vary depending on your deployment (same datacenter, cross-region, etc.).*

### Which Serialization Format Should I Choose?

| Choose | When | Read (5KB) | Write (5KB) |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|
| **Bincode** | Default choice, balanced performance | 1.8 µs | 4.9 µs |
| **Rkyv** | Read-heavy, large payloads | 1.1 µs | 4.9 µs |
| **RON** | Debugging, human-readable | 3.0 µs | 3.9 µs |

**Performance at scale (1MB payload):**

| Format | Read | Write | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Rkyv | 166 µs | 301 µs | Zero-copy deserialization shines |
| Bincode | 197 µs | 215 µs | Fastest writes |
| RON | 308 µs | 2.21 ms | Human-readable, good for debugging |

*Note: JSON format is also supported but ~300x slower on reads — not recommended for production. Use RON instead if you need human-readable cache values for debugging.*

### Should I Use Backend Composition (L1/L2)?

Composition adds overhead but provides benefits like local caching with distributed backup:

| Configuration | Read (5KB) | Write (5KB) | Use Case |
|---------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Moka only | 1.9 µs | 4.0 µs | Single server |
| Moka + Redis (2-tier) | 3.2 µs | 7.5 µs | Multi-server with local cache |
| 3-tier | 5.0 µs | 11.9 µs | Complex hierarchies |

**Each tier adds ~3-4 µs** for small payloads. For large payloads, serialization dominates.

### Cache Key Format

Cache keys can be serialized as Bitcode (compact) or UrlEncoded (readable):

| Key Complexity | Bitcode | UrlEncoded | Savings |
|----------------|---------|------------|---------|
| Simple (method + path) | 32 bytes | 50 bytes | 36% |
| Complex (9 parts) | 302 bytes | 345 bytes | 12% |

Bitcode is the default. Use UrlEncoded if you need to inspect keys in Redis.
