Feature: Response Version Predicate Functionality

  Background:
    Given hitbox with policy
      ```yaml
      Enabled:
        ttl: 10s
      ```

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version Eq operation - match HTTP/1.1 response
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Version: "HTTP/1.1"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version Eq operation - short format - match 1.1 response
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Version: "1.1"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version Eq operation - non-matching version returns non-cacheable
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Version: "HTTP/2"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 0 records

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version In operation - version in allowed list cached
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Version:
          - "HTTP/1.1"
          - "HTTP/2"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version In operation - short format versions
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Version:
          - "1.1"
          - "2"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version In operation - version not in list returns non-cacheable
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Version:
          - "HTTP/2"
          - "HTTP/3"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 0 records

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version Eq operation - case insensitive matching
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Version: "http/1.1"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"

  @response @version
  Scenario: Version combined with Status predicate
    Given response predicates
      ```yaml
      - Status: 200
      - Version: "HTTP/1.1"
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"
